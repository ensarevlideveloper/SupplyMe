Purpose:
This app was programmed to be a solution finder, during the COVID-19 crisis. This is my contribution to the community.

App Description:
Faced with the global impact of a global crisis, we as humans are faced with problems that are completely new to us.

One of them is panic buying: fear leads people to make thoughtless and ill-considered decisions. As a result, they buy goods in excessive quantities. Toilet paper stocks in supermarkets around the world sell out within minutes. As a result, people are left without toilet paper, and underground toilet paper exchanges are created in the meantime.

Another problem arises from the introduction of mandatory respirators:
Many countries have decided to make masks mandatory in public places to prevent the spread of the virus.
As a result, people fear the same trend of panic buying masks. In addition, some of us are not informed about the stores that actually sell masks.

These problems can only be solved by ourselves. 
Better than ever, we understand that knowledge is power (-"Scientia potentia est"), which is why WE need to work as a community and provide information. This is where SupplyMe comes in.

SupplyMe aims to be a solution to these problems by providing a platform for information sharing. 
-Features: 
*Shows the status of toilet paper supplies at nearby stores.
**By the help of the COMMUNITY and YOU providing and updating this information.
*Showing stores that sell masks and their stock levels.
**by the help of the COMMUNITY and YOU adding stores and updating this information.

Additional Information:
This project was named ToiletPaperMe in the beginning but after adding respirators, it was better to rename it ;)
